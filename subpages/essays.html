                <p id="body-paragraphs">Past all its pink and blue shimmering glory, there is a much deeper symbolism behind the gemstone dragonfly barrette that Coraline adorns for the complete runtime of the 2009 stopmotion film directed by Henry Selick. While there are a number of various interpretations for the significance of dragonflies across different cultures, 3 in particular stick out to me when it comes to Coraline's characterization: Native American Traditions, Japanese symbolism, and Celtic Folklore.

In the 2009 film Coraline directed by Henry Selick, the Beldam's costumes, connection to African culture, and imagery surrounding her character all point to her being inspired by a Goliath Beetle, and not a spider as most of the audience theorizes...</p>

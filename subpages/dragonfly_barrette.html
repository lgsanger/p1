                <p id="body-paragraphs"><b>1. Dragonfly ancestors of record-breaking proportions flew in prehistoric times</b> - Dragonfly-like creatures were some of the first winged insects to evolve, appearing on the scene roughly 300 million years ago. Modern dragonflies have wingspans of up to only about five inches, but an early relative of dragonflies in the fossil record—called Meganeuropsis permiana—has been found with a wingspan longer than two feet.
                    Some scientists theorize that high oxygen levels during the Paleozoic era allowed these dragonfly ancestors to grow to monster sizes.</p>
                
                <p id="body-paragraphs"><b>2. Dragonflies are stunningly diverse</b> - There are more than 3,000 known species of dragonflies, all of which belong to the order Odonata, which means “toothed one” in Greek. Technically, however, dragonflies don’t have teeth—the name refers to the insect’s serrated mandible, which comes in handy for holding and crushing prey. Damselflies are fellow members of Odonata, though they’re distinct from dragonflies, which have thicker bodies and bigger eyes. A handy way to tell them apart is to look at their wings at rest—dragonflies sit with their wings splayed flat, while resting damselflies close their wings together.

                <p id="body-paragraphs"><b>3. For the majority of their lives, most dragonflies are aquatic</b> - Before growing into their familiar, flying form, baby dragonflies live in the water. In their larval stage, the aquatic dragonflies eat just about anything—tadpoles, mosquitoes, fish, other insect larvae and even each other. This phase typically lasts one to three years—some species, however, are aquatic for just weeks or months, while others might remain as larvae for half a decade.

                    At the end of its larval stage, a dragonfly crawls out of the water; then, its exoskeleton cracks open and releases its abdomen, which had been packed in like a telescope. Its four wings come out, and the body dries and hardens over the next several hours.
                    
                    From there, most dragonflies live fast, so to speak—their adult life span is typically only one to three weeks, though some make it more than two months.

                <p id="body-paragraphs"><b>4. Dragonflies are expert fliers</b> - They can fly straight up and down, move forward and backward, hover like a helicopter and even mate in midair. Dragonflies rank among the world’s fastest flying insects, capable of reaching roughly 35 miles per hour.

                    Their aerial prowess is a crucial survival skill. If a dragonfly can’t fly, it will starve, because the insects only eat prey they catch while flying. But they’re resilient: “A dragonfly can be missing an entire wing and still capture prey,” Stacey Combes, now a researcher at the University of California, Davis, told the New York Times’ Natalie Angier in 2013.

                <p id="body-paragraphs"><b>5. Dragonflies are precise, lethal hunters</b> - Dragonflies catch their insect prey by grabbing it with their feet or mandibles. They’re so efficient in their hunting that, in a 2013 study, dragonflies captured approximately 95 percent of the prey released into their enclosure.



                    That’s “wildly high compared to where most predators are,” as Rachel Crane, a biologist at the University of California, Davis, said in a statement last year. For comparison, certain birds of prey—like owls, falcons and hawks—catch prey only about 25 percent of the time.

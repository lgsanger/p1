                <h3 id="theory-header">Coraline Is Trapped!</h3>
                <p id="body-paragraphs">Kinda basic, but a lot of people think Coraline never actually escaped the Other World. The biggest reason? The Cat disappearing at the end. He could do that in the Other World, so if she was really back home, why would that still be happening?</p>
                
                <p id="body-paragraphs">Then there's the theory that Wybie's grandma made a deal—Coraline's life in exchange for Wybie's. Maybe she knew more than she let on and saw an opportunity to get her grandson back safely. Coraline thinks she won, but the Beldam still got what she wanted.</p>
                
                <p id="body-paragraphs">Some people take it even further and say Coraline actually did get the button eyes, but she sees the world how she wants to. That's why we don't notice anything different—because we're seeing it through her eyes. Now, the authors did disprove this theory, but it's still fun to consider.</p>

                <h3 id="theory-header">Mr. Bobinsky is a Chernobyl Victim...</h3>
                <p id="body-paragraphs">A popular theory suggests that Mr. Bobinsky's strange appearance—his blue-tinted skin, lanky frame, and eccentric behavior—is due to radiation exposure. The medal he wears; it's a Russian Hero Medal, specifically one awarded to liquidators who helped clean up after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.</p>
                
                <p id="body-paragraphs">Radiation exposure could explain his blue skin tone and why he seems a little off. It might also be why he spends so much time isolated on the roof, talking to mice. Maybe his obsession with training them is his way of coping with the past.</p>

                <h3 id="theory-header">The Grandma Traded Wybie's Place for Coraline's</h3>
                <p id="body-paragraphs">To go more into detail about another theory I mentioned, a lot of people believe that since Wybie's grandma doesn't usually rent out the Pink Palace to kids, it's suspicious that she still accepted Coraline's family.</p>
                
                <p id="body-paragraphs">The theory suggests that Wybie was originally supposed to be the Beldam's next victim, just like his great-aunt. But his grandma, knowing the danger, made a trade—allowing Coraline's family to move in so the Beldam would focus on her instead. If true, it means Coraline was doomed the moment they arrived, unknowingly taking Wybie's place in the cycle.</p>
                
                <p id="body-paragraphs">It's never confirmed, but it would explain why Wybie's grandma was so strict about keeping him away from the house. Maybe she wasn't just being overprotective—maybe she already knew what was waiting inside.</p>
